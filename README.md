# ETH Zürich Information Security Lab 2022

This is a MSc Computer Science course at ETH Zürich. It provides a broad, hands-on introduction to Information Security, introducing adversarial thinking and security by design as key approaches to building secure systems.

**Important Note**: 
1. I only pushed **part of the python-related** project works that are already graded. The other part stays confidential at the current stage.
2. Other programming used in the lab include: java, tamarin, go, and c.
